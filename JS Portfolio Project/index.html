        <h2>why software development?</h2>
        <p>
            i have a passion for computers that i developed as a child.  ihad taken some programming courses in college
            and a few years ago, the passion was rekindled.  i ended up completing an online coding bootcamp focused on ruby on rails
            and applying that knowledge to create an application for a my previous employer protrux systems inc.
            during that time i found that when I am coding, it never actually feels like work.  
            that feeling is what i have always wanted in a career and I am lucky to have found it.
        </p>
        <p>
            i enjoy creating things as well as improving them.
            to me, software development feels like an art.  
            being able to create and improve something that can allow people to better their daily lives is what drives my passion.
